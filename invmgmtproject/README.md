# Django Inventory System

The product and staff management web application built in Django with Bootstrap and HTML in the front end is a web-based tool designed to manage products, staff and orders more efficiently. This application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily view and manage information related to their products and staff.

The application is built using the Django web framework, which provides a robust and scalable platform for building web applications. Bootstrap and HTML are used in the front end to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. This combination of tools allows for a seamless user experience, with a modern and intuitive design that makes it easy for users to navigate and manage their products and staff.

## Installation

Once the repository has been cloned, please run the following command on the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The application has two main sections: the product management section and the staff management section. In the product management section, users can add new products, edit existing products, and delete products as needed. They can also view a list of all products.

In the staff management section, users can manage employee records, including contact information, user name, and other important details. The users can also assign images to their employee profile and update their data. Also, the project has a register form where a user can be created. The profile, however, must be assigned by the admin.
